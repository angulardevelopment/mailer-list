A visitor should be able to add his email to the mailing list

[Ideal expectation from the webapp]
front end

(Use any free html welcome mail template in respect of time. Need not edit it)   There must be a Login functionality for the admin to login. Admin should be able to trigger the mail to all users in the database at any time. There must be a WYSIWYG Editor embedded so that, admin can send mail with a custom subject and content to all users in the mailer list.
